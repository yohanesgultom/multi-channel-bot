            <description><![CDATA[**PLEASE READ THE COMPLETE JOB DESCRIPTION &amp;amp; RESPOND**<br /><br />
Overview of the work (additional access &amp;amp; details will be shared upon interview eligibility)<br /><br />
- A specific set of data is coming from &amp;quot;water temperature checking devices&amp;quot;<br />
- This data is stored into AWS<br />
- You will need to create a simple automated script/API that could:<br />
a) Categorize data into specified tabs/columns<br />
b) Ready to be consumable by any other third-party website/app to integrate this script/API directly from AWS<br />
NOTE: A part of the script is already built in Python, however, we want this to be re-built in Node.js (so you have a great reference already which makes your work easier)<br /><br />
You should:<br />
1. Have knowledge of working with AWS<br /><br />
2. An expert in Node.js<br /><br />
3. Have some knowledge of Python (will help you to refer to the existing work)<br />
Please use the word quarantine at the start of your response so I know you read through carefully.<br /><br />
4. Should be willing to work on a long-term association<br />
Note that a Phase 2 of this work is already on papers - which will involve creating a Dashboard for the vendors &amp;amp; Admin - therefore, we are looking for a team-player who could continue to work with us on this project as it is expanded.<br /><br />
This job is open for Hourly, however, once we have mutually agreed upon an estimation, we would like to award the job on a fixed contract.<br /><br />
All the best!<br />

            <description><![CDATA[This would be ongoing little changes as needed.<br /><br />
Today we need to have some features turned off for some of our pages. We would like chatbox, header and footer to be optional per page.<br /><br />
Today we also need the ability to have a button on the page to send you back to the page you came from. ( keeping some information in the URL )<br /><br />
Looking for someone that is always available to quickly jump in and make a few changes as the need comes up.<br /><br />
Must be able to speak English fluently and be willing to talk over video chat sometimes or audio as a minimum as I will screen share to show what I need.<br /><br />
MUST use the upwork screen time recording as we need to go back and see the changes made.<br /><br />
If this sounds like you... please respond quickly as I will hire today!<br /><br />
We are going live in a few days and then it will get crazy :)<br /><br />
